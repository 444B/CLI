Intro:
Lets move the sandbox.log file from 1_mv/ to this new directory 2_rm/
However,  if we run the ls command, we see that we already have a sandbox.log here! lets delete it quickly before we get confused

Tasks:
1. using the rm command on the "sandbox.log" file located in this directory to delete it
2. Once you have successfuly deleted the file, copy or move the sandbox.log file from 1_mv/ to 2_rm/ , your choice!
3. Once completed. rename the file to "final.log", using the previously learned command (mv)

Once the task is complete, you should have 2 files in the 2_rm directory:
- readme.txt
- final.log

Useful Commands:
rm
mv
cp

Tips:
1. If you are stuck, read the man page or use google
2. Write down any questions you may have!
3. Work with the other guys together to understand it
4. When asking me (444b), let me know what you have tried first :)

Completed:
Move on to the next activity, in the directory 3_less
cd there and carry on the excercises as described in the readme.txt of 3_less
