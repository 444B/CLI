Intro:
Sometimes you need to copy a file. Maybe its to make a backup or because you need your own copy.

Task:
Successfully copy the file in this directory called "Linux_2k.log"
make a new copy called "Linux_2k.log.bck" and have it in the same directory

Once the task is complete, you should have 3 files in the 0_copy directory:
- Linux_2k.log
- Linux_2k.log.bck
- readme.txt

Useful Commands:
cp

Tips:
1. If you are stuck, read the man page or use google
2. Write down any questions you may have!
3. Work with the other guys together to understand it
4. When asking me (444b), let me know what you have tried first :)

Completed:
Move on to the next activity, in the directory 1_mv
cd there and carry on the excercises as described in the readme.txt of 1_mv
