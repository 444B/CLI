One of the quickest ways to use Linux on an android device is with Termux
You can get Termux from the [app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en&gl=US)
Install it and you will have a terminal on your phone :)
You should make a directory called sandbox that you can test and learn in as we dont want to make any unwanted changed to the device

Termux has alot of power but the one from the Play store is underpowered because of licencing issues or something
There is the full version on [F-Droid](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Installing_from_F-Droid) which will provide you with the full power of Termux (and with it, great responsability)

F-droid is an open source app store for android
