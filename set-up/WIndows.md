# Windows
There are numerous methods for installing on windows, as described below  

# Virtualbox
By far the easiest (arguably) is to install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for whatever OS you have  
Then grab a copy of any Linux ISO. If this is your frist time, go for something Debian based. I do reccomend [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)[^1]  
This method will install Virtualbox, which will create a platform for creating virtual computers. We basically simulate an entire new computer in your existing machines memory.  
We simulate the virtual computer by giving it an ISO file, in this case Ubuntu
# Dual Boot

# WSL

You can go for Desktop image if you are a beginner or a Server install image if you are already a little familiar with the concept of CLI. Both will do fine.  
Desktop Image : 2.9 GB  
Server Install Image : 1.2 GB
