Intro:
Now that we have a copy of a file, lets move it to this new directory
Once it is in here, we will also rename it
we need to move the log file into this directory. We can either copy it (cp) or move it (mv)

Tasks:
1. using the mv command on the "Linux_2k.log" file, relocate the file from the previous directory (0_cp/) to this directory (1_mv/)
2. Once you have successfuly moved the file, rename it to a new file named "sandbox.log". Both moving and renaming may be done with the mv command :)

Once the task is complete, you should have 2 files in the 1_mv directory:
- readme.txt
- sandbox.log

Useful Commands:
mv

Tips:
1. If you are stuck, read the man page or use google
2. Write down any questions you may have!
3. Work with the other guys together to understand it
4. When asking me (444b), let me know what you have tried first :)

Completed:
Move on to the next activity, in the directory 2_rm
cd there and carry on the excercises as described in the readme.txt of 2_mv
