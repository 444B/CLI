A breakdown of this command [ And optionally read up on the man file if you wouild like ]

```shell
git
```
This is the git protocol that is used to control software versions. You can do alot with it but for the purposes of this excercise we will be pulling a version of this collection of code to our local directory
```shell
    clone
```
in the git manual, we can see there are many options. The clone option take the URL and makes a copy into the local directory of your terminal (you can see which directory you are in with pwd , remember? ;)
```shell
          https://github.com/444B/CLI.git
```
This is the URL we are copying! Whatever files and directories are here, we will be creating a new copy in our current directory
<br/>
Once you have successfully cloned the repository, naviagte into it and take a look. 
use the next command to read the file
```shell
cat readme.txt
```
# Good luck!
