# Welcome
Practice ground for a CLI course
<br/>
Copy this to your current directory by running the following command
```shell
git clone https://github.com/444B/CLI.git
```
<br/>
<br/>
A breakdown of this command [ And optionally read up on the man file if you would like ]

```shell
git
```
This is the git protocol that is used to control software versions. You can do alot with it but for the purposes of this excercise we will be pulling a version of this collection of code to our local directory
<br/>
<br/>
```shell
    clone
```
in the git man file, we can see there are many options. The clone option take the following URL and makes a copy into the local directory of your terminal (you can see which directory you are in with pwd , remember? ;)
<br/>
<br/>
```shell
          https://github.com/444B/CLI.git
```
This is the URL we are copying! Whatever files and directories are here, we will be creating a new copy in our current directory
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have successfully cloned the repository, navigate into it and take a look. 
use the next command to navigate to the first excercise and read the text file
```shell
cd 0_copy/
cat readme.txt
```
# Good luck!
