# This Repository is meant to be a guide to Linux Courses. 
There are 2 Folders;
1) set-up (of the Linux environment)
2) excercises (to get more familiar)

Please pick a setup path below and let me know if you have any further suggestions

# Set-up
This folder offers a range of solutions to getting started on Linux. depending on your devices and permissions
it will cover:
- [Windows](https://github.com/444B/CLI/blob/main/set-up/WIndows.md)
    - [Dual Boot](https://github.com/444B/CLI/blob/main/set-up/WIndows.md#Dual%20Boot)
    - [Virtualbox](https://github.com/444B/CLI/blob/main/set-up/WIndows.md#Virtualbox)

# excercises
These excercises are meant to be used during the course to practise and learn.
Another amazing resource is [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html), a remote computer problem solving game that teaches you linux commands
We will use this during the course as we become more familiar with the OS and tools

## Goodluck! 
Just remember, its okay to not know the answer. The secret sauce is googling until you find an answer :)
